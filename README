Using the REST client here http://github.com/archiloque/rest-client

I wrote a Zendesk API client that:

 

1. Creates a user

2. Creates a ticket with that user as requester

3. Marks that ticket as solved (not implemented)

 

You can create a Zendesk account by signing up at http://www.zendesk.com/

 

There is more information about the Zendesk API available here...

  http://www.zendesk.com/api/

and the documentation specifically for the REST interface...
